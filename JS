JavaScript
1. What’s the difference between the following three “car” approaches?
function Car(){}
This is a function named Car that when invoked, can produce different results and this can also be reused multiple times.

var car = Car();
This is a variable car that has been assigned the value/s that is returned by the function CAR(). This car variable can also be reassigned with new values.

var car = new Car();
This variable can be used to create a new Object. This car variable can also be reassigned with new values that can be returned whenever variable car is used.

2. Explain what AJAX is and it’s advantages/disadvantages.
Creates asynchronous web app on the clientside.
Advantages
Since it uses client side scripting, it reduces network calls to the server thus optimizing user experience with the site.
Disadvantages
Not 100% supported by all browsers.
Not secured.

3. Describe how event bubbling works in the context of clicking on the “Hello World” text:
<body>
<div id=”container”>
<span id=”textContainer”>Hello World</span>
</div>
</body>
If Hello World text is clicked, all events associated with the text will propagrate to the parent. Hierarchy from the inside(child) to the parent it will propagate is: SPAN, DIV, BODY, HTML, DOCUMENT, WINDOW

4. Create a loop that iterates up to 100 while outputting "fizz" at multiples of 3, "buzz" at
multiples of 5 and "fizzbuzz" at multiples of 3 and 5.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<script>
var text = "";
for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  document.write(i);
  if( i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0 ) {
        document.write(" fizzbuzz");
    } else {
        if( i % 3 == 0 ) {
            document.write(" fizz");
        }
        if( i % 5 == 0 ) {
            document.write(" buzz");
        }
    }
    document.write('<br>');
}
</script>
</body>
</html>

5. Please fix the following erroneous JavaScript code.
/**
* Returns the header element.
*
* @return {(object|null)} The JQuery header element or null if the element does not exist */
function getHeaderElement() {
// Get header element by its id. header = $(“myHeader”);
if (header === null
&& TypeOf header === undefined
){
console.log(‘header element exists!”);
}
console.log(“
header element does not exist!
“))
return header }

Answer
/**
* Returns the header element.
*
* @return {(object|null)} The JQuery header element or null if the element does not exist */
function getHeaderElement() {
  // Get header element by its id. header = $(“myHeader”);
  if (header != null || header != undefined){
    console.log("header element exist!”);
  }
  else {
    console.log(“header element does not exist!“);
  }
  return header;
}
